📋 RamerLabs ClipVault — Full Description

RamerLabs ClipVault is a powerful and lightweight clipboard manager for Windows designed to boost productivity by giving you complete control over your copy-paste workflow. Unlike the default Windows clipboard that forgets items once replaced, ClipVault stores and organizes all your clipboard history — including text, images, and files — so you never lose important snippets again.

✨ Key Features

Clipboard History: Automatically saves everything you copy (text, images, and file lists).

Search & Ranking: Quickly find items using fuzzy search with instant suggestions.

Global Hotkeys: Use customizable shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+V, etc.) to paste recent items or toggle the manager.

Pin & Star Items: Keep your most important clips always at hand.

Text Transformers: Built-in tools for URL cleaner, Base64 encoder/decoder, case converters, whitespace cleaner, slugify, and more.

Import & Export: Save or restore your clipboard history with JSON files (images embedded as Base64).

Preview Panel: Instantly view text, images, and file paths inside the app.

Lightweight Database: All history is stored locally in a secure SQLite database with thousands of entries supported.

Privacy Control: Sensitive data detection and optional expiry timers for sensitive entries.

License Validation: First-run prompt asks for your license key, validated securely online, then stored in your DB for future use.

Modern UI: Polished Tkinter + ttkbootstrap interface with themes (light/dark).
